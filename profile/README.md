# Welcome to Crypto Wallet Fortress!

The wallet optimizer allows you to:
1. Define asymmetric keys.
2. Generate an optimal wallet with up to 6 keys using exhaustive search, or a wallet with 7-12 keys using a simulated annealing process (exhaustive search is too long).
3. Deploy the wallet.
4. Interact with the wallet through a CLI (can run on many machines with different keys).

Please go to https://crypto-wallet-designer.github.io/ to view the live frontend for this project (**you can deploy contracts from there**)

After you've deployed a contact, you can use our CLI client at: https://github.com/Crypto-Wallet-Designer/wallet-client-cli/

This project was conducted in the [IC3](https://www.initc3.org/) blockchain camp 2022.
It is based on the [previous website](http://walletdesign.dev/) and the [research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1522.pdf) by Ittay Eyal (presented at Tokenomics 2021).
