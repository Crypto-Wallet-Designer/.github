# Welcome to Crypto Wallet Fortress!

The wallet optimizer allows you to :
1. Define asymmetric keys
2. Generate an optimal wallet for up to 6 (exhaustive search), and a hueristic "optimal" wallet for 7-12 keys (cannot perform an exhaustive search)
3. Deploy the wallet
4. Interact with the wallet through a CLI (can run on many machines with different keys)

Please go to https://crypto-wallet-designer.github.io/crypto-key-calculator/ to view the live frontend for this project (**you can deploy contracts from here**)

After you've deployed a contact, you can use our CLI client at: https://github.com/Crypto-Wallet-Designer/wallet-client-cli
